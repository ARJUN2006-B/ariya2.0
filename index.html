    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The central plot of the movie follows a somewhat traditional trajectory, reminiscent of numerous Indian films and works like "A History of Violence," adapted from a graphic novel by John Wagner. Nonetheless, Director Lokesh, in collaboration with his writing team, skillfully injects a rejuvenating dose of suspense into the storyline with brilliantly executed plot twists. It's worth noting that the flashback segments seemed hurried and unconvincing, which affected the second half, and the pacing in the first half could have benefited from some tightening, especially the over-budget hyena sequence.</p>

    <h3>review</h3>
    <p>This movie is Karthik Subbaraj's career best and this movie is amazing. The amount of care and thought put into every scene makes this movie the masterpiece that it is. It makes us think about duality of the society, what is morally corrupt and what is not and it is very well written. Karthik Subbaraj's team strikes again with one of the best camera and editing work in Kollywood history. This movie is a miles better than Jagame Thandhiram and Navarasa's Peace. Chiyaan and Dhruv Vikram, Bobby Simha, Sananth and Simran's characters were very well written and one of the best characters from Indian Cinema ever.</p>

    <h2><b>3.Master</b></h2>
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVOCAX6U0AAthj1.jpg:large">
    <h3>review</h3>
    <p>Master's biggest plus point is vijay sethupathi. If bhavani's character was played by a normal actor, he would have been clearly overshadowed by thalapathy vijay. But since its vjs, the character is well written and is shown equally powerful than hero. We can't call him villain instead an antihero. Another plus point is anirudh's music and bgm which stood as the backbone of the film. Thalapathy vijay performed as usual for his fans. Color tone was perfect. But the film is very predictable and lacks logic for example an alcoholic person quits drinking without any proper treatment. On the whole, master is a blasting entertainer mainly due to vjs act as the ruthless gangster which makes it for me a better vijay film after a long time. First half is mainly dominated by vjs but second half is thalapathy show all the way. Those who expected to watch it for director will be disappointed but i kept those expectations away and enjoyed the film throughout.</p>

    <h3>review</h3>
    <p>Watched "soorarai potru" ...inspiring tale with lot of life .I don't have much to say about this one as I ain't having words to describe this master class work ..such is the impact...brilliantly scripted with some outstanding performance chained with some remarkable making and cuts...I dont wana review suriyas performance as it's one of his career best ..if u loved his performance in varanam aayiram then this one will be a treat for u.....he is a gem in all sorts ....aparna balamurali deserves applauds for her natural acting ...not but the least the captain sudha kongara did his work to perfection and it's a must watch for all movie lovers.The king is back.</p>

    <h2><b>5.vikram</b></h2>
    <img src="https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2021/07/10/273e787ba809e725948334340c658e68_original.jpg">
    <h3>review</h3>
    <p>The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kamal Hassan starrer "Vikram" has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with "Maanagaram (2017)", "Kaithi (2019)" and "Master (2021)", all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.
